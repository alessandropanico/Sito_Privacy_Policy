        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Content Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for the

                character art) is generated by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model. The AI may produce inaccurate,
                imperfect, or, in rare cases, copyrighted results. Manga Chronicles does not warrant the accuracy or
                legality of AI-generated content. Use of such content is at your sole risk and responsibility.</li>

        <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">5. Monetization and Anti-Circumvention Rule (AdMob)</h2>
        <p>Manga Chronicles is a free service supported by third-party advertising (provided by Google AdMob). Access to
            certain content generation features (specifically, the creation of **Stories, Covers, and Characters**) is
            conditioned on viewing an advertisement (rewarded video/interstitial).</p>
        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item bg-danger text-white">**Prohibition of Ad Circumvention:** It is **strictly
                prohibited** to use software, VPNs, ad-blockers, or any other method intended to block, hide, modify, or
                bypass the viewing of advertisements required to access premium features.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item bg-danger text-white">**Penalty for Abuse:** Any attempt to circumvent the
                monetization mechanism (AdMob) or to manipulate the use of ads will be considered a serious violation of
                these Terms. **Manga Chronicles reserves the right to immediately and permanently suspend or delete the
                user's account in the event of proven abuse, without prior notice or refund.**</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided "as is." Manga Chronicles provides no express or implied warranties regarding the
            operation of the application. We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential
            damages arising from the use or inability to use the Service or AI-generated content.</p>
        <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">7. Changes to the Terms</h2>
